    "# Air Quality Benefits of Emissions Testing Capstone Part I: Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "## ----Project Context----\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2017 The Pennsylvania legislature was deciding whether to continue emissions testing in the state, and which test(s) to use if emissions testing was to continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of a capstone project, I was part of a team that had a goal of using data to determine benefits of emissions testing and inform public policy descisions in PA. The data at our disposal consisted of emissions test results from Colorado over the span of 2010-2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the provided data, the team sought to investigate the following questions related to the overall project goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How can the emissions inspection results/data inform us about actual vehicle emissions over time?\n",
    "- How does a particular model yearâ€™s emissions change over time?\n",
    "- What amount of emissions are we preventing from entering the environment by testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "After cleaning the data, as explained below, The end result of this process was generation of vehicle emissions datasets for years 2010-2016, with final datasets retaining ~30-60% of the original dataset records.\n",

    "Before starting analysis to answer the team's main questions, there was a desire to create a clean data set from the original Colorado data. The clean data set would include only relevant columns, and take out outliers or discrepancies found in the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original datasets the team used were from Colorado emissions testing results. Data from 2010-2016 was available to the team. Each testing year's data held 500,000 - 1,000,000 rows and 250+ columns, with each row representing a unique inspection. These rows included data about the vehicle such as make/model/year/engine data, as well as test and inspection results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Colorado, generally speaking, two emissions tests were run on vehicles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An OBD test. This test checks for conditions that waste fuel and shorten engine life, such as a loose gas cap.\n",
    "3. An IM240 test. This test puts a vehicle on a treadmill and simulates different driving conditions. A sensor put at the tailpipe during this test measures actual emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from the vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above tests were conducted according to Colorado's testing regimen. For light duty vehicles, the following rules defined testing requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vehicles within their first 7 model years are exempt from testing\n",
    "- Vehicles Model Year 1982 and newer must be inspected every other year\n",
    "- Vehicles Model Year 1981 and older and diesel Vehicles Model Year 2003 and older must be inspected every year\n",
