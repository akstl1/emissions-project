    "\n",
    "## ----Project Context----\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of a capstone project my team and I were tasked with using data to inform the Pennsylvania legistlature's decision on whether to continue vehicle emission testing and which tests to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data at our disposal consisted of emissions test results from Colorado over the span of 2010-2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the provided data, the team sought to investigate the following questions as the overall project goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How can the emissions inspection results/data inform us about actual vehicle emissions over time?\n",
    "- How does a particular model yearâ€™s emissions change over time?\n",
    "- What amount of emissions are we preventing from entering the environment by testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "The above questions would inform our recommendations to the state legistlative bodies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary Of Results\n",

    "## ----Emissions Standards Context----\n",
    "\n",
    "Emissions standards in the United States began after the passage of the 1970 Clean Air Act (CAA). The CAA defined the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) role in protecting air quality and the ozone layer. To protect air quality, the CAA defined initial vehicle emissions limits for a variety of pollutants including Carbon Monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first set of emissions standards, now termed Tier 0 standards, took effect in 1975. In 1979 and 1981, Congress tightened these standards even further and in 1990 a formal set of new emissions limits was defined; these standards, implemented starting in 1994, were deemed Tier 1 standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since that time, the emissions standards have been tighened several times. In 2000, Tier 2 standards were defined and were implemented starting in 2004. In 2014, Tier 3 standards were defined and are being phased in between 2017 and 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most vehicles on the road today are held to either Tier 3 or Tier 2 standards, though cars model year 2003 and older are held to Tier 1 standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the EPA, emissions standards have led to significant decreases in vehicle emissions including up to a 98% reduction in NOx emissions in light duty vehicles on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "More information about emissions standards can be found <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/light-duty-vehicle-emissions#history\">here<a/>."

    "## ----Data Context----\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting analysis to answer the team's main questions, I was tasked with creating clean datasets from the original Colorado data. The clean data sets would include only relevant columns, and take out outliers or discrepancies found in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original datasets the team used were from Colorado emissions testing results. Data from 2010-2016 was available, and each testing year's data held 500,000 - 1,000,000 rows and 250+ columns. Each row included data from a single vehicle inspection including information about the vehicle such as make/model/year/engine data, as well as test and inspection results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Colorado, generally speaking, two emissions tests were run on vehicles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An OBD test. This test checks for conditions that waste fuel and shorten engine life, such as a loose gas cap.\n",
    "3. An IM240 test. This test puts a vehicle on a treadmill and simulates different driving conditions. A sensor put at the tailpipe during this test measures actual emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from the vehicle. These emissions are compared against applicable EPA thresholds to determine the overall result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above tests were conducted according to Colorado's testing regimen. For light duty vehicles, the following rules defined testing requirements:\n",
    "- Vehicles within their first 7 model years are exempt from testing\n",
    "- Vehicles Model Year 1982 and newer must be inspected every other year\n",
    "- Vehicles Model Year 1981 and older and diesel Vehicles Model Year 2003 and older must be inspected every year\n",
    "\n",
