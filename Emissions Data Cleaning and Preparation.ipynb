    "In 2017 The Pennsylvania legislature was deciding whether to continue emissions testing in the state, and which test(s) to use if emissions testing was to continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of a capstone project, I was part of a team tasked with using existing data to determine potential benefits of emissions testing to help inform public policy descisions. The main questions the team sought to answer were:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How can the emissions inspection results/data inform us about actual vehicle emissions over time?\n",
    "- How does a particular model yearâ€™s emissions change over time?\n",
    "- How much emissions are we preventing from entering the environment by testing?\n",
    "- What are the emissions impacts of disagreeing OBD and IM240 results?\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, the team needed to clean datasets at our disposal so they could be used for analysis. Below the code to clean the data is developed and explained. The end result of this process was generation of vehicle emissions datasets for eyars 2010-2016, with final datasets retaining ~50-60% of the original dataset records.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Context\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting analysis to answer the team's main questions, there was a desire to create a clean data set from the original Colorado data. The clean data set would include relevant data, and take out outliers or discrepancies found in the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original datasets the team used were from Colorado emissions testing results. Data from 2010-2016 was available to the team. Each testing year's data held 500,000 - 1,000,000 rows and 250+ rows, with each row representing a unique inspection. These rows included data about the vehicle such as make/model/year/engine data, as well as test and inspection results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Colorado, generally speaking, two main tests were run on vehicles:\n",
    "1. An OBD test. This test checks for conditions that waste fuel and shorten engine life, such as a loose gas cap.\n",
    "2. An IM240 test. This test puts a vehicle on a treadmill and simulates different driving conditions. A sensor put at the tailpipe during this test measures actual emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from the vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above tests were conducted according to Colorado's testing regimen. For light duty vehicles, the following rules defined testing requirements:\n",
    "- Vehicles within their first 7 model years are exempt from testing\n",
    "- Vehicles Model Year 1982 and newer must be inspected every other year\n",
    "- Vehicles Model Year 1981 and older and diesel Vehicles Model Year 2003 and older must be inspected every year\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of cleaning the Colorado datasets is described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clustering Records\n",
    "\n",
    "In many analyses, the group wanted to analyze a fleet of vehicles. This could be an analysis by car make, model or year. To do so, the team created a unique ID to define these fleets using vehicle VINS. Certain digits in a vehicle VIN identifies it's make, model, year, and engine type. A standard vehicle VIN has 17 digits. When looking at the original Colorado dataset, there were many vehicles with shorter VIN lengths. To ensure that vehicles were being grouped and analyzed correctly,all records with shorter VINs were not included in the cleaned data set."
